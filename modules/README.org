* Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: modules
:END:
*** bundles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: bundles
:END:
- Module bundles that act as system presets, or simply extended
  configuration on top of a window manager so it does not pollute my
  host module imports.
  - =modules.nixos.base=
    - Critically important stuff that each host should at least have
      (where =modules.nixos.critical= is imported)
  - =modules.nixos.niri-bundle=
    - Niri bundle of my current fav niri setup

*** critical
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: critical
:END:
- Important Utilities that need to be included in my configs, most tend
  to be under =modules.nixos.critical=
- Hosts will not need to import the critical module directly, this is
  handled through the =modules.nixos.base= bundle under the bundles
  directory
- Other important modules
  - =modules.nixos.grub=
  - =modules.nixos.uefi=

*** features
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: features
:END:
- Top level dir of general features, apps, window managers, shell
  utilities, etc.
  - Window Managers/Desktops I support
    - Niri =modules.nixos.niri=
    - Mango =modules.nixos.mango=
    - oxwm =modules.nixos.oxwm=
    - Xfce =modules.nixos.xfce=
    - Cosmic =modules.nixos.cosmic=

*** hardware
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hardware
:END:
- Location for host specific utilities, these tend to be defined by
  =modules.nixos.hostname=

*** options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: options
:END:
- Options that the rest of the system can expect to always be present.
  =modules.nixos.options= and =flake.settings= for flake level options

*** overlays
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: overlays
:END:
- I still don't really understand these. =flake.overlays.default=

*** packages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: packages
:END:
- Derivations that I need to build as part of my system configuration.

*** utility
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: utility
:END:
- This is mostly just house keeping stuff, and meta related things like
  helper libraries.

*** +hostname
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hostname
:END:
- Where =modules.nixos.hostname= is declared and imports are added.

*** README.md
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: readmemd
:END:
- You're reading it.

*** home.nix
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: homenix
:END:
- Not exactly what you might think, this does not live in home manager,
  but simply configures it and some other things.

*** nixosConfigurations.nix
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: nixosconfigurationsnix
:END:
- The system configurations for this flake. Every host will have an
  entry here.
