:END:
- Non-dendritic configuration now lives on the
  [[https://github.com/argosnothing/nixos-config/tree/legacy][legacy]]
  branch.
- Dendritic config based around import-tree and flake parts, with an
  emphasis on blurring the lines between home and system.
- If you are one of those mentioned in the credits here and don't want
  to be mentioned, just let me know.
* Things I do
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: things-i-do
:END:
- Dendritic pattern with modules folder being evaluated at flake level.
- Impermanence in system and home. Per module persistance so wm switches
  don't pollute user space.
- Hjem
- Sops dependent install process, bring your own keys, secrets.
- Coupled user/system modules, inspired by
  [[https://github.com/saygo-png/nixos][saygo's]] configuration.
- Some code here, such as the impermanence module is +stolen+ borrowed
  from [[https://github.com/iynaix/dotfiles][iynaix's]] config

*** Meta

- My aspiration is that this repo will be beginner friendly enough to be
  used as an educational tool for learning to create your own config. If
  there is anywhere you feel could be explained in more detail feel free
  to message me, and I will work towards incorporating it in a README.md
  file in the appropriate directory.
  - I also have a
    [[https://github.com/argosnothing/nixos-kickstart][starter config]]
    that has a similar structure if you want to start from scratch with
    stuff like dendritic and zfs.
- My config makes heavy use of README.md, and I try to have every
  directory contain its own readme with more granular descriptions of
  its purpose and modules.

*** Notes, implementation details.
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: notes-implementation-details
:END:
- hjem user module is aliased to =hj=
- Themes are currently largely handled =imperatively= through matugen (
  using noctalia-shell )
- Parts of my config are not managed explicitly through nix. I like to edit certain things on the fly so i use [[https://github.com/argosnothing/nixos-quantum][nixos quantum]] to bind mount certain config files in a similar way to the impermanence module.
